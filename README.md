# Final Project Report 2021
To submit final project proposal:
* For this repository, and clone your forked copy.
* Create a directory named `<net-id1>-<net-id2>`  where `net-id1` is the NYU
  NetID of the first member of your group, and `net-id2` is the NetID of the
  second member. For example if your NetID is `ja111` and your partner's NetID
  is `pb122` then you should create a directory named `ja111-pb122`.
  If you are working on the project alone your directory should just be named 
  `<net-id>`, and if you are in a three person group your directory should be
  named `<net-id1>-<net-id2>-<net-id3>`.
* Copy your project report to this directory. The project report can either be a
  markdown file or a PDF file. If submitting a PDF please make sure it is
  formatted reasonably. Aim for brevity, your report should be short but
  communicate what you think were the most important things you found.
* Commit your changes, and push to your forked copy.
* Submit a pull request to this repository, entitle you pull request `Project
    Proposal <net ID 1> <net ID 2>`.
